### INTRODUCTION
**Stark Health Clinic**, a leader in technology-driven healthcare, aims to enhance patient outcomes and optimize resource allocation through predictive modeling. This project leverages machine learning to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes, enabling early and targeted interventions. By analyzing patient data, it seeks to develop a robust and accurate model to predict diabetes onset. The initiative includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the training of multiple supervised learning models to identify critical patterns. This proactive approach will reduce healthcare costs, improve patient care, and strengthen the clinic's role in combating diabetes.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
- Diabetes poses significant health risks to patients and creates financial challenges for healthcare providers.
- Current early detection methods at Stark Health Clinic lack precision, resulting in missed opportunities for timely interventions.
- Inaccurate predictions lead to delayed care, increased complications, and higher treatment costs.
- The clinic requires a reliable and robust predictive model to identify high-risk individuals effectively.

### AIM OF THE PROJECT
- Develop a robust machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes onset in individuals.
- Enable early identification of high-risk patients to facilitate timely and targeted preventive interventions.
- Improve patient outcomes by reducing diabetes-related complications through proactive care.
- Optimize healthcare resource allocation by prioritizing at-risk individuals.
- Lower long-term healthcare costs associated with diabetes management and treatment.
- Strengthen Stark Health Clinic's role as a leader in technology-driven and patient-focused care.

### METHODOLOGY
- **STEP 1: Data Cleaning:**  
  - Handle missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.  
  - Remove duplicate records and irrelevant columns that do not contribute to prediction.  
  - Identify and correct anomalies in the dataset to ensure data quality.  

- **STEP 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Visualize feature distributions, relationships, and correlations using plots like histograms and heatmaps.  
  - Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that may influence loan defaults.  
  - Formulate hypotheses to guide feature engineering and model selection.  

- **STEP 3: Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Scale or normalize numerical features and encode categorical variables for compatibility with machine learning models.  
  - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets to ensure robust evaluation.  

- **STEP 4: Model Training:**  
  - Select and train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.  
  - Conduct hyperparameter tuning and k-fold cross-validation for model improvement.  
  - Experiment with multiple algorithms and compare their performance.  

- **STEP 5: Model Evaluation:**  
  - Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
  - Analyze performance across subsets (e.g., borrower income levels) and perform error analysis.  
  - Compare results to a baseline model to measure improvements.  

- **STEP 6: Model Optimization:**  
  - Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.  
  - Apply regularization or ensemble methods to address overfitting and enhance performance.  
  - Refine feature selection and ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
